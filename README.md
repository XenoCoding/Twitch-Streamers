# Twitch-Streamers

<b>This is an intermediate front end project for the freecodecamp.com Fornt End development course.</b> The project has been completed and submitted, but more features are being added. The nature of ajax calls makes it difficult to add certain futures, however.

The project should have the following functionality:
<ul>
  <li>Display information about a list of Twitch channels, including their name, logo, channel banner, and game that they stream.</li>
  <li>Sort streamers based on whether they are currently streaming or not by the click of a button. </li>
  <li>Add another streamer to the list based on the user's input.</li>
  <li>Display information about a live stream when the user hover's over a streaming channel, including a preview of the stream and how many people are watching.</li>
</ul>
